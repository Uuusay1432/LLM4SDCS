First, the requirement model $r^*$ to be analyzed is determined by Stepwise Policy, and $E^*$ which is defined as the set of environment models to be synthesized with $r^*$ is derived. Next, executing of DCS between $r^*$ and $E^*$ leads to create a new environmental model $e^*$ under which the requirements of $r^*$ are satisfied. Finally, the sum of E nor included in $E^*$ and $e^*$ is redefined as a new $E$ and $R$ not included in $r^*$ is redefined as a new $R$. By repeating the above process until $R$ is an empty set, a controller which satisfies $R$ can be created."
